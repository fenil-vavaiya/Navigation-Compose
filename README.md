# Bottom Navigation App 

## Overview 

I've built a simple Bottom Navigation app using Jetpack Compose! This project was a fun way to dive deeper into Compose and explore how easily it enables the creation of clean and responsive navigation.

## Features 

- Modern UI: Built entirely using Jetpack Compose, showcasing clean and declarative UI design.

- Bottom Navigation: Smooth and intuitive navigation between screens.

- Responsive Design: Ensures a great user experience across different screen sizes and orientations.
